# Calculator App

This is a basic calculator app which has been created using React + Vite.

The skeleton of this was created using the Vite template which is shown on their [website](https://vite.dev/guide/). Futher details can be found below.

This app can perform basic calculations: such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The `C` button is used to clear the input box. Selecting this is required to action another calculation.

The layout of this Calculator app has been designed to look similiar to existing apps like this and perform basic functions. It is assumed that these options are what are user would require for these calculations.

## How to run the app locally
You will need to ensure the correct versions are installed to run this locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
